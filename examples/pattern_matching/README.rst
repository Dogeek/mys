Pattern matching
================

Use pattern matching to promote an object to its class from one of its
traits. Pattern matching can match object contents or value as well.

.. code-block::

   $ mys run
   Trait foo.
   Trait bar.
   Other trait: Fie()
   Zero integer.
   Five integer.
   String foo.
   Other string: bar
